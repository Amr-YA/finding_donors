# finding_donors
Udacity Nanodegree Project

In this project, supervised learning techniques are applied on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

First, some data exploration is performed to learn how the census data is recorded. Then, a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques applied on data to manipulate it into a workable format. After that, several supervised learners were selected to evaluate their performance on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
Finally, model optimization and tuning is done on the selcted model.
